# DodgeGameGeneticAlgorithim
A simple game of dodge the enemy, with a bit of machine Learning Genetic Algorithm to make it better

The reason this doesn't get past average 4 with 1 hidden layer and 6 with 3 is that this game is too luck-based to perform a good genetic algorithim, atleast for my level, and thus my next few projects with this will probablybe a more set in stone concrete game where it doens't change game to game

All algorithims are self wrote, but the mutation function was influenced by CodeBullet's dinoGame.
